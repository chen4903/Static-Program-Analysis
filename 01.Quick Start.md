# Quick Start

## Brief

The three major parts of a programming language are as follows:

- Theory: Language design, Type system, Semantics and logics ...
- Environment: Compilers, Runtime system ...
- Application: `Program analysis`, Program verification, Program synthesis

> Background: In the last decade, the language cores had few changes, but the programs became significantly and more complicated.
>
> Challenge: How to ensure the reliability, security and other promises of large-scale and complex programs?

Why We Need Static Analysis?

- Program Reliability: Null pointer dereference, memory leak, etc.
- Program Security: Private information leak, injection attack, etc.
- Compiler Optimization: Dead code elimination(比如，有一个完全不会被调用到的变量声明), code motion(比如，for循环中每次都初始化某个变量，可以将其提取到for循环外面), etc.
- Program Understanding: IDE call hierarchy(鼠标悬停到函数上面，看到调用信息、函数信息), type indication, etc

## What is Static Analysis

### Brief

Static analysis analyzes a program *P* to reason about its behaviors and determines whether it satisfies some properties before running *p*.

- Does P contain any private information leaks?
- Does *P* dereference any null pointers?
- Are all the cast operations in *P* safe?
- Can v1 and v2 in *P* point to the same memory location?
- Will certain assert statements in *P* fail?
- Is this piece of code in *P* dead(so that it could be eliminated)?

> Unfortunately, by **Rice's Theorem**, there is no such approach to determine whether *P* satisfies such non-trivial properties, i.e., giving **exact answer**: YES or NO.

### Rice's Theorem

"Any non-trivial property of the behavior of programs in a r.e. language is undecidable." 【递归可枚举(基本上我们见到的编程语言都是)编程预言的任何重要的特性都是不可判定的】

> r.e.(recursively enumerable) = recognizable by a Turing-machine

A property is trivial if either it is not satisfied by any r.e. language, or if it is satisfied by all r.e. languages; otherwise it is non-trivial.

> non-trivial properties
>
> ~= interesting properties
>
> ~= the properties related with run-time behaviors of programs

总结上面的话：一个正常的语言写的程序，如果你觉得那些runtime有用的、你感兴趣的*程序行为*是不存在的，他们的特性是无法确定的，即：不存在Perfect Static Analysis. 举个例子：Static Analysis不可能告诉你这个程序有问题，只能跟你说可能存在问题。

### Perfect Static Analysis

Perfect Static Analysis需要同时满足：Sound, Complete.

>  可以理解为：sound是“正确的我都说了”，complete是“我说的都是正确的”。比如：实际上一个程序有10个漏洞，Sound报出15个，Complete报出5个(但这5个都是真的漏洞)

我们没有一个完美的Static Analysis，但我们可以尽可能地做一个有用的Static Analysis。也就是说，做一个Sound或Complete的。

- Useful static analysis
  - Compromise soundness(false negatives)：漏报
  - Compromise completeness(false positives)：误报

Mostly compromising completeness: Sound but not fully-precise static analysis.(宁可杀错，不可放过)

### Necessity of Soundness

- Soundness is critical to a collection of important(static-analysis) applications such as compiler optimization and program verification.

- Soundness is also preferable to other(static-analysis) applications for which soundness is not demanded, e.g., bug detection, as better soundness implies more bugs could be found.

### Summary

Static Analysis: ensure(or get close to) soundness, while making good trade-offs between analysis precision and analysis speed.

## How To Static Analysis

Two words to conclude static analysis: Abstraction + Over-approximation(Transfer functions, Control flows).

There is an example: Determine the sign(+,-,or 0) of all the variables of a given program.

### Abstraction 

Determine the sign(+,-,or 0) of all the variables of a given program.

### Over-approximation: Transfer Functions

- In static analysis, transfer functions define how to evaluate different program statements on abstract values.
- Transfer functions are defined according to "analysis problem" and the "semantics" of different program statements.

### Over-approximation: Control Flows

As it's impossible to enumerate all paths in practice, flow merging(as a way of over-approximation) is taken for granted in most static analyses.
